        The Ultimate Plugin for Snippets in Vim - forked version~


Please also have a look at README.rst which talks about why this fork
exists. Section 3 is most important

1. Contact / need help / bugs

bugs:
file against github.com/MarcWeber/ultisnips unless you're sure they also
happen on the [parent_ultisnips] project. 
Then use [SirVer's bugtracker]

help:
If in trouble read documentation. If you still have trouble you can contact me
by irc (MarcWeber @ irc.freenode.net) or mail: marco-oweber@gmx.de.
Also See bugs at README.rst

==============================================================================
2. Installation

I don't care. I personally prefer vim-addon-manager (cause I wrote it for good
reasons), but all the other tools pathogen, vundle, .. should also get the job
done.

You may want to add the external snippet repository
github.com/honza/snipmate-snippets to runtimepath - then all snippets are
available

==============================================================================
3. SETUP / CONFIGURATION / how does this fork work ?

Which snippets are available? ~
You implicitely tell UltiSnips which paths to look for snippets in.
default implementation is a VimL function 
called SnippetFilesForCurrentExpansionDefaultImplementation
but you can also provide a python implementation instead.

Snippet files are reloaded lazily as needed automatically (eg when timestamp of a
snippet file changes). While loading snipmate snippets some errors may happen.
Then quickfix is populated so that you can explore the cause fast (:cope).
For details See doc/UltiSnips.txt section "3.3 Snippet Search Path".

.vimrc setup ~

    " declare global configuration dictionary so that config options can be added:
    let g:UltiSnips = {}

    " Use old snipmates default mappings (look them up in
    " plugin/UltiSnips.vim)
    " ExpandTrigger, ListSnippets, JumpForwardTrigger, JumpBackwardTrigger
    " yourself. Eg use <c-j> to jump to next placeholder, which is UltiSnips
    " default. It makes sense to use a different mapping so that you don't
    " expand var names. in for loops if they also represent a snippet.
    let g:UltiSnips.InterfaceFlavour = "SnipMate"
    let g:UltiSnips.JumpForwardTrigger = "<c-j>"

    " Now its time to tell UltiSnips about which snippets to load.
    " You do so for snipmate snippets and UltiSnips snippets individually.
    " This example illustrates a setup loading snipmate snippets.

    " See plugin/UltiSnips.vim, it has much additional documentation.

    " Because I want to use the snippet snippets 'default' does not load
    " filetype.snippets snippet files. 'all' reperesents the snippets like box
    " which are meant to be present always. (snipmate was using _ for this)
    " For cpp, already all snippets have been converted to UltiSnips, so use
    " those - but only the one provided by my ~/.vim direcotry.

98a. Notes for snipmate users:
_.snippets namespace (used always) is "all.snippets" namespace in UltiSnips.
You can still keep using "_" as seen above.

UltiSnips provides two different mappings for expand and jump to next
placeholder. This is because an expansion name might be the same as a var
name. So consider adopting to using two different mappings.

Also be aware that UltiSnips snippets are more powerful. Eg nested
placeholders are supported. See doc/UltiSnips.txt

==============================================================================
98b. Notes for UltiSnips users:
Please read the comments about how snippets are found and loaded carefully.
This changed.
